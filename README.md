Lateral ventricle volume trajectories predict response inhibition in older age - a
longitudinal brain imaging and machine learning approach. PLOS ONE Manuscript draft

**Abstract**

**Objective:** In a three-wave 6 yrs longitudinal study we investigated if the expansion of lateral ventricle (LV) volumes (regarded as a proxy for brain tissue loss) predicts third wave performance on a test of response inhibition (RI).
**Participants and Methods:**  Trajectories
of left and right lateral ventricle volumes across the three waves were quantified using the longitudinal stream in Freesurfer. All participants ($N=74$;$48$ females;mean age $66.0$ yrs at the third wave) performed the Color-Word Interference Test (CWIT). Response time on the third condition of CWIT, divided into `fast`, `medium` and `slow`, was used as outcome measure in a machine learning framework. Initially, we performed a linear mixed-effect (LME) analysis to describe subject-specific trajectories of the left and right LV volumes (LVV). These features were input to a multinomial logistic regression classification procedure, predicting individual belongings to one of the three RI classes. To obtain results that might generalize, we evaluated the significance of a *k*-fold cross-validated f1 score with a permutation test, providing a *p*-value that approximates the probability that the score would be obtained by chance. We also calculated a corresponding confusion matrix.
**Results:** The LME-model showed an annual $\sim3.0$% LVV increase. Evaluation of a cross-validated score using $500$ permutations gave an f1-score of $0.462$ that was above chance level ($$p=0.014$$). $$56$$% of the fast performers were successfully classified. All these were females, and typically older than $$65$$ yrs at inclusion. For the true slow performers, those being correctly classified had higher LVVs than those being misclassified, and their ages at inclusion were also higher.
**Conclusion:** Major contributions
were: (i) a longitudinal design, (ii) advanced brain imaging and segmentation procedures with longitudinal data analysis, and (iii) a data driven machine learning approach including cross-validation and permutation testing to predict behaviour, solely from the individual's brain ``signatures‚Äù (LVV trajectories).
